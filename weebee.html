        <p>I designed the Wee Bee’s branding from the ground up, it is a very personal project to me. Starting with sanding the outside and painting it a bright teal and yellow. The location of the trailer was wonderful, but nobody knew it was there because its muted beige made it blend into the buildings behind it. One of my passions is Bee and pollinator health. I choose the name and the logo to highlight that, money from the Wee Bee’s sales put in local pollinator gardens. I feel very strongly about healthy, nourishing foods. With this in mind, I created all of my recipes from scratch, no sugar and superfood ingredients. I made a chai, turmeric latte and caramel latte with my created recipes. I sourced my coffee beans from an ethnically sources roasters, ran by women for 25 years. I installed bronze pourer Stands in the window, so customers could watch their coffee being made while I told them about the bean I was brewing. I had a weekly tip duel. Customers could put their tip into one of two jars betting on different duel outcomes. Winners were posted on the facebook site. Everything was organic, the cups were compostable and the coffee sweetened with local honey. This truck was tiny but filled with love.
