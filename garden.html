            <p>In a small town, nestled in a valley of redwood trees, sits the town of Boulder Creek. For years there was a large empty lot next to an old laundry mat that sat in this town since the 1970s. I found it on a walk from a landscaping client, I was scoping out a spot for a community garden. I met the owner and the idea was sprung just like our famous sunflowers. I became co-owner of that little laundry mat and created a flourishing community garden in the old leach field next door.  The valley was very dark due to the thick forest of redwoods, people were delighted to have a place to grow sun-loving plants, so close to the center of town. A beautiful community sprouted out the garden, and more tomatoes then you could imagine. Our sunflowers were so tall it seemed they were competing with the giants that surrounded them. They became the town attraction.

            I taught sustainable farming practices, and water resource management. We hosted seed and plant swaps, clothing trades and a barter fest to challenge people to find new ways of using the things they have lying around, to rethink what resources look like. We had a community compost pile anyone in the community could contribute to, finding new ways to lighten the load on landfill waste. Extra food was donated to the local branch of food not bombs in Santa Cruz.

            In the laundry mat, I switched to earth-friendly soaps and to washing machines that used less water. Rebranded, fixed the leaks in old plumbing, created a book exchange. I managed five employees that worked in the Landry service.
